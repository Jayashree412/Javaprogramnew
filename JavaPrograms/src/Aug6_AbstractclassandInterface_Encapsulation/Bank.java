//Interface class is this so no need of body or "Abstract keyword". We just create a method here to be used by multiple classes.
//Without body method is only possible. by default compiler adds abstract keyword here in Interface class
//No method body that is only abstract methods are only allowed here
//In Java 8 we can have static methods and default methods 
//Multiple Inheritance is achieved here
